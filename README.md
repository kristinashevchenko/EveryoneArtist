## How to start client

Before running client locally you should install the following:

1. NPM
2. Node (at leat 14)

More info https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

P.S. I have NPM 8.1.0 and Node 16.13.0 but I think higher versions will work too without problems.

To run client:

1. Go to client folder.
2. Run ```npm install``` in client folder to install dependencies. You should run it for the first time for sure. Later, if you see that some package versions were updated in package.json you should run it again. You don't need to run it each time.
3. ```npm start```
